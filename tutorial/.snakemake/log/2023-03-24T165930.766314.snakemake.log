MissingOutputException in line 80 of /afs/cern.ch/work/a/ascarabo/rare-charm-d0-hhee/Optimization/gammacombo/tutorial/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
root/scan1dDatasetsProb_PDF_Dataset_50p_BFsignal_PIPIEE_3.root completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
